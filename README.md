## Business Goal and Machine Learning Solution
*(Details on the business goal and how the machine learning solution addresses it)*

## Data Enrichment Process

### Overview
In the Taxi Demand Prediction and Management project, we enrich the Chicago Taxi Trip dataset with additional data to enhance our analysis. A key component of this process involves integrating weather data to explore its impact on taxi trip patterns.

### Integrating Weather Data
Using the Open-Meteo.com Weather API, we fetch data such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation. This information is crucial in understanding how weather conditions influence taxi demand in Chicago. The data is fetched in both hourly and daily granularity, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the correlation between weather variations and taxi trip frequency.

### Data Granularity and Analysis
Our analysis emphasizes hourly data granularity. This approach helps us capture the dynamic nature of both weather conditions and taxi trip demand, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of their interplay. Hourly data provides the detail necessary for accurate demand forecasting, crucial for operational planning and resource allocation.
