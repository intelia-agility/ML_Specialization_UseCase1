## Introduction
In bustling urban environments, the efficiency of taxi services is crucial for both the operators and the city's mobility. This project focuses on leveraging Machine Learning (ML) to predict taxi demand based on time, date, and location factors. By anticipating high-demand areas and times, taxi companies can optimize their fleet management, reduce customer wait times, and improve service availability.

## Business Goal and Machine Learning Solution
The primary business goal is to "Increase the efficiency of taxi distribution throughout the city to reduce customer wait time by predicting demand." This involves analyzing historical taxi usage patterns to predict future demand and enable a more dynamic allocation of taxi resources.

### Machine Learning Use Case
The use case for ML in this context is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast taxi demand. By using historical data and identifying patterns associated with different times, dates, and locations, the model can make informed predictions about future needs.

### Solution's Impact on Business Goal
The ML solution incorporates an end-to-end TensorFlow pipeline that processes the Chicago taxi trips dataset. The workflow includes data enrichment, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and model training and evaluation. This comprehensive approach ensures accurate demand forecasting, facilitating efficient taxi distribution and reducing customer wait times.

## Data Enrichment Process

### Overview
The data enrichment process is a critical step in our pipeline designed to enhance the quality and informational value of the taxi trip data. By integrating external datasets and creating new features, we significantly improve the modelâ€™s ability to predict demand more accurately.

### Missing Values Identification and Handling
**Description**: Our data enrichment begins with identifying missing or incomplete data. We have implemented robust methods to scan and quantify missing values to ensure the integrity of our dataset.

**Code Snippet**:
```python
# Code snippet to identify and summarize missing values
nan_summary = df_hourly[nan_rows].isna().sum(axis=1)
print(nan_summary)
