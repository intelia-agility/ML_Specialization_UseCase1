## Introduction
In bustling urban environments, the efficiency of taxi services is crucial for both the operators and the city's mobility. This project focuses on leveraging Machine Learning (ML) to predict taxi demand based on time, date, and location factors. By anticipating high-demand areas and times, taxi companies can optimize their fleet management, reduce customer wait times, and improve service availability.

## Business Goal and Machine Learning Solution
The primary business goal is to "Increase the efficiency of taxi distribution throughout the city to reduce customer wait time by predicting demand." This involves analyzing historical taxi usage patterns to predict future demand and enable a more dynamic allocation of taxi resources.

### Machine Learning Use Case
The use case for ML in this context is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast taxi demand. By using historical data and identifying patterns associated with different times, dates, and locations, the model can make informed predictions about future needs.

### Solution's Impact on Business Goal
The ML solution incorporates an end-to-end TensorFlow pipeline that processes the Chicago taxi trips dataset. The workflow includes data enrichment, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and model training and evaluation. This comprehensive approach ensures accurate demand forecasting, facilitating efficient taxi distribution and reducing customer wait times.

## Data Enrichment Process

### Overview
In the Taxi Demand Prediction and Management project, we enrich the Chicago Taxi Trip dataset with additional data to enhance our analysis. A key component of this process involves integrating weather data to explore its impact on taxi trip patterns.

### Integrating Weather Data
Using the Open-Meteo.com Weather API, we fetch data such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation. This information is crucial in understanding how weather conditions influence taxi demand in Chicago. The data is fetched in both hourly and daily granularity, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the correlation between weather variations and taxi trip frequency.
```python

# Fetch the data from the API
response = requests.get('[API URL]')
data = response.json()

# Create DataFrames from the 'hourly' and 'daily' data
df_hourly = pd.DataFrame(data['hourly'])
df_daily = pd.DataFrame(data['daily'])

### Data Granularity and Analysis
Our analysis emphasizes hourly data granularity. This approach helps us capture the dynamic nature of both weather conditions and taxi trip demand, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of their interplay. Hourly data provides the detail necessary for accurate demand forecasting, crucial for operational planning and resource allocation.
