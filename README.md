### README: Execution Order for Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that are part of a comprehensive data analysis and modeling workflow for the Chicago Taxi Trips dataset. To ensure a smooth workflow and proper understanding of the process, it is important to follow the recommended sequence for running these notebooks:  

1. **Data Enrichment.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: Following the EDA, this notebook focuses on enriching the data. It includes integrating external data sources, enhancing features, and preparing the dataset for more sophisticated analysis and preprocessing.
  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook is the starting point of the analysis. It provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the taxi trips dataset. Here, we visualize and understand the dataset's characteristics, including distributions, patterns, and potential anomalies.


3. **Data Preprocessing.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook is crucial for preparing the dataset for modeling. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, data normalization, and segmentation into training, validation, and test sets. This step is essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of the data fed into the models.
 

4. **TFX TaxiDemandInteractivePipeline.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: The final step involves using the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) pipeline for building and evaluating machine learning models. This notebook takes the preprocessed data and employs it in a structured pipeline to train, validate, and deploy models for predicting taxi demand.
  

**Note**: It is crucial to execute these notebooks in the specified order, as each notebook builds upon the work done in the previous one. Skipping any step or executing them out of order may lead to incomplete analysis, errors, or misleading results.
